**WubbabooMark** is aimed to detect traces of usage of software debuggers or special software designed to hide debugger presence from the debugee by tampering with various aspects of the program environment.

The typical set of debuggers nowadays is actually limited to a few most popular solutions like Ghidra/IDA/OllyDbg/x32+x64dbg/WinDbg and so on. There is a special class of software designed to "hide" the debugger from being detected by the debugee. Debugger detection is usually used by another software class—software protectors (e.g. Themida/VMProtect/Obsidium/WinLicense). Sometimes, software that counteracts these detections is referred to as "anti-anti-debug" or similar. Personally, I find all of this "anti-anti" kind of annoying because we can continue and it will be "anti-anti-anti-..." with all sense lost somewhere in the middle.

What this "anti-anti" class of software actually does is create a landscape of additional detection vectors, while some of the most notorious pieces compromise operating system components’ integrity and security for the sake of being able to work. And all of them, absolutely all of them, bring multiple bugs due to the inability to correctly replicate the original behavior of hooked/emulated functions. Sounds scary? Not that scary, as most users of this software (they call themselves "reversers/crackers") know what they're doing and do it on purpose... right? Carelessly implemented targeted anti-detection methods against known and well reverse-engineered commercial protectors create a bunch of new artifacts. WubbabooMark uses publicly known, up-to-date, and enhanced methods to list those artifacts.

The continuous VMProtect drama generates (at the moment of writing this text in June 2023) a lot of fun, so I just can't stay away from it. Since VMProtect recently went "open-source" under the DGAF license, I had an opportunity to look closer at its "anti-" stuff. What VMProtect has under the hood clearly demonstrates the authors following mainstream "scene" trends with little original creativity in some aspects due to the limits of being a commercial product and software support requirements. Direct syscalls, Heaven’s Gate? What year is it now? However, reinventing this stuff even in 2018 seems to have doomed some of this so-called "anti-anti" software to death.

Anyway, we have some debuggers, some "tampering tools/plugins," etc. Let's see how good they are!

# System Requirements

x64 Windows 10/11 and above.

Anything below Windows 10 is unsupported. Well, because those OSes were discontinued by Microsoft and mainstream industry. What a surprise! What a surprise! Forget stone age systems and move on.

Windows 11 preview/developer builds WARNING: since this program relies on completely undocumented stuff, there can be problems with the most recent versions that the program doesn't know about, resulting in false-positive detection or program crashes. Use at your own risk.

# How To Run Test And Don't Ask Questions Next

1. Download or compile from source "Skilla.exe"
   * If you want to compile it yourself: Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and above with a recent Windows SDK installed. Compile configuration is "Release", not "Debug".
   * If you want to download a precompiled binary, it is in the Bin folder of this repository.
2. Load your debugger, set up your tampering plugins, load "Skilla.exe".
3. Run the program in the debugger and watch the output. If something crashed, including your debugger, it is your own fault (maybe~).
4. Look for results. Normally, there should be nothing detected—literally ZERO wubbaboos in the list. 
5. If you want to repeat the test, there is no need to restart "Skilla.exe" or repeat (2)(3)—go to the menu and use "File -> Scan".

Did you find something that looks like a false positive or a bug? Feel free to report it in the issues section!
You can save the generated report using the "Probes -> Save As ..." menu. The file will be saved in comma-separated values (CSV) format.

# False positives

Antimalware/anticheat software may cause false positives due to the way these software classes work. Make sure you understand what you do. This is not an AV/EDR benchmark nor a testing tool.

# Driver Bugs

While encountering random BSODs from the best and funniest "super hide" software, I was about to make a fuzzer test just because every driver I compiled contained improper handling of syscalls it intercepts. However, since authors of this software don't care and usage of all these drivers is limited to a small group of masochists, this idea was dropped at an early stage. Well, what can I say—never use anything from that super hiding stuff on a live machine or you risk losing your data due to a sudden bugcheck.

# Virtual Machine Detection

Not an aim of this tool and will never be added. This tool will work fine with a VM.

# Links

Here I would like to put some useful links, enjoy.

Debuggers first!
* x64dbg (https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg) - x64 debugger with UI inspired by OllyDbg. Despite being overflown with annoying graphics, questionable features and tons of bugs, it is currently one of the best of what we have.
* HexRays IDA (https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/) - costs a lot, can a lot, everybody has it for free, "F5" is an industry standard in ISV reverse-engineering departments.
* Ghidra SRE from NSA (https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) - not much to say about it, except it is a freeware open-source competitor of the above product.
* WinDbg (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools) - Microsoft user/kernel debugger with support built into the operating system. A bit of hardcore for newcomers, but the most powerful as an R0 debugger.
* Immunity Debugger (https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/) - Requires Python and doesn't support x64, trash for historical purposes.
* There exist some funny clones of ollydbg+x64dbg with a number of different names (cpudbg64, asmdbg32, asmdbg64 - author can't decide); however, author attitude demonstrates typical chaos in mind and development, not to mention phishing schemes used on the project domain. 
* HyperDbg (https://github.com/HyperDbg/HyperDbg) - hypervisor-assisted kernel/user mode debugger.

* VirtualDbgHide (https://github.com/Nukem9/VirtualDbgHide) - utilizes LSTAR hook, a typical broken "anti-" driver, never use it on a production machine, avoid at all cost.
* ColdHide_V2 (https://github.com/Rat431/ColdHide_V2) - a basic and failed ScyllaHide clone.
* DBGHider (https://github.com/hi-T0day/DBGHider) - IDA plugin that does some trivial things.
* MineDebugHider (https://github.com/zhouzu/MineDebugHider) - C#-based trivial API interceptor with invalid anti-detection logic in author's mind.

* XAntiDebug (https://github.com/strivexjun/XAntiDebug) - few ideas from VMProtect "improved" by author.

Here I should put some links to what is now reinvented wheels about debuggers detection that you can easily find in the world wide web. It is mostly a time-machine to when Windows XP was all new and shiny.

* Collection of ancient stuff by Checkpoint (https://anti-debug.checkpoint.com/) Unsure where they copied some of these, probably from al-khaser (https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser), or vice-versa.
* Peter Ferrie, Anti-Debugging Reference (http://pferrie.epizy.com/papers/antidebug.pdf?i=1) A must put, because literally everyone when you look at references has links to it, so I'm a bit ashamed that I've never fully read it, however it must be something good, isn't it?
* Peter Ferrie, Anti-unpacker tricks (https://pferrie.tripod.com/papers/unpackers.pdf) I believe this one is where the above had roots in.
* Peter Ferrie, Anti-unpacker tricks VB series (https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2008/12/anti-unpacker-tricks-part-one) All parts of it, I think, have more details than above.
* An Anti-Reverse Engineering Guide By Josh Jackson (https://forum.tuts4you.com/files/file/1218-anti-reverse-engineering-guide/) Very ancient just like all the above.
* Enough of this museum.
* Anti Debugging Protection Techniques with Examples (https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/367-anti-reverse-engineering-protection-techniques-to-use-before-releasing-software) A more recent combination of known stuff.
